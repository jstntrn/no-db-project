# PROJECT SUMMARY

Create a recipe search and shopping list builder for people that need to plan for large groups and for many meals. This will be accomplished by utilizing a recipe API to display searchable recipe cards. Recipes will be selected and the shopping list will compile common ingredients into a shopping list with summed quantities. A report can be generated to show how much of each ingredient goes to which meals.

## Required Components

### Header / Search Bar
##### use query string parameter for search bar
notes

### Multiplier Inputs (# of meals, # of people, servings per person)
notes

### Recipe Display (with allergy filters)
##### use column with card type display to meet multiple components and stateless components requirements
##### use express GET to meet requirement
notes

### Shopping Cart (Get, Put, Post, Delete)
##### *Meets required stateful component
##### *Meets required POST, GET, PUT, DELETE (URL parameters)
##### *POST will use req.body to add to local server
notes

### Shopping List Generator
##### list component

# React Notes
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
